# Configure  Theatre view with the new info

First of all, you must translate the new fields and configure Theatre View :

Translate the fields
-------------

OK, Nothing has to be done for english users ! If so, skip this part !
But follow the process if not ...
  
When you install JRScrap, new fields are created within JRiver Media Center.
These Fields are :

* ActorAsCharacter
* Casting
* Character
* Executive Producer
* Novel
* Production Company
* Production Design

This field can be translated for an non-english user by modifying the corresponding file in
'C:\Program Files (x86)\J River\Media Center 19\Data\Languages\' (default)

Configure Theatre View
-------------

In the JRiver's MC  Tool Menu, choose Option> Theatre View and  'Customize file info panel'.
Here you can add fields you want, as an example : ..
