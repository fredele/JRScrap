# JRScrap

What ?
-------------

Well, it' a scraper written as an add-on for the **JRiver Media Center** software.

It connects to : 

* **TheMoviedb.org API**
http://www.themoviedb.org/
(currently Version 3)

* **TheTVdB.org API**
http://thetvdb.com

* **OpenSubtitles.org API**
http://www.opensubtitles.org
 

In fact, the information for know retrieved by JRiver are far from perfect, this app was created in order to retrieve Movie information in my native language : **FRENCH**.
As the APIs supports it, it could be used for other languages, (german and italian tested.)

**JRscrap replaces the old JRMoviedB, JRTVdB and JROpenSub no longer on my github account**

Troubleshooting / Before you write me ...
-------------
The app. does not function on your system ?

- Is your machine runnig JRiver as Client ? My app. does only run for local files ...
- No COM connection with JRiver ? Re-install JRiver as Admin user under Windows. 

Now you can write me, in English or French (J' écris en anglais-européen car c 'est un soft qui fonctionne pour pleins de langues ...) if you have suggestions, bugs, strange behaviour ... I garantee nothing but will try to help in any case  .
